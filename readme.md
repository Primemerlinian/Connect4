## Connect 4 pseudocode 
My Constants are going to be my winning combos 

My variables to track the game are going to be board, turn, winner

My cached element references will be the circle (which is every circle on the board). The message to keep track of whoâ€™s turn it is. 
The board section itself and the reset button.  So far.

Event listeners for when the game first starts up. 
There will also be another event listener during the game which will determine if the game is still in progress or if there is a winner
 


JavaScript 
Will have my cached element references for the board reset button reset button and 
It is going to be 6 rows wide and 7 columns down so just like tic tac toe I will have 42 null spaces

Need initialized function for the render function to call 
Handleclick function for player clicking a square
Stub out render function

Add get winner function



### Next Steps/future enhancements: 
Adding animation where chips or hearts will fall down, adding new fonts and style to make it more interactive. I also want to add a scoreboard and a front page that will explain the rules and then take you to the game.
